# The user manual (for boards running my code)
## Normal dialing
Just pull the dial round from the desired number to the fingerstop and release immediately.

## Dialing * and #
for * Pull the dial from ‘1’ and hold on the fingerstop for 2 seconds until you hear a beep, release, and a tone for * will be generated.

For # do the same but use ‘2’.

## Redial
Pull the dial around from ‘3’ and hold on the fingerstop for 2 seconds. Release when you hear the beep, and the last number will be redialed.

## Speed dials
There are 7 speed dial locations. 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Pull the dial around  to the fingerstop and hold for 2 seconds, release when you hear the beep and the desired number will be dialed.

## Programming a speed dial
Pull the number of the desired location around to the fingerstop and hold for 4 seconds, you will hear a two-tone beep. Release the dial.

You are now in programming mode. Now simply dial out the number you wish to store, releasing the dial immediately after each digit. You will hear a simple beep after digit. Once complete, hang up, the number is now saved.

When doing this you will likely have your telephone exchange furiously beeping at you because you haven’t dialed a number. If annoying, you can enter the BT “quiet line test” (For people in the UK) during programming.
